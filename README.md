# Metro_App_puneSub-Station
The Metro Navigation System is a C++ console-based application that simulates a metro network, allowing users to explore various features such as:

Listing metro stations.
Displaying the metro map.
Calculating the shortest distance between two stations.
Calculating the estimated travel time.
Finding the shortest path between any two stations.
The application uses graph data structures and algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm and DFS to determine optimal paths and distances in the metro system.

Features
List all stations
Displays all the metro stations available in the system with their serial numbers.

Show the metro map
Provides a depth-first traversal (DFS) of the metro system, listing all connected stations.

Get shortest distance
Computes and displays the shortest distance (in kilometers) between any two user-specified stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Get shortest time
Calculates and displays the estimated time (in minutes) to travel between two stations, based on the shortest distance.

Get shortest path
Shows the shortest route (sequence of stations) between two stations, allowing users to understand the stops they will encounter along the way.
