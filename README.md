# Metro_App_puneSub-Station
The Metro Navigation System is a C++ console-based application that simulates a metro network, allowing users to explore various features such as:

Listing metro stations.
Displaying the metro map.
Calculating the shortest distance between two stations.
Calculating the estimated travel time.
Finding the shortest path between any two stations.
The application uses graph data structures and algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm and DFS to determine optimal paths and distances in the metro system.
